# Roblox Talent Jam

The Roblox Developer Talent Jam was a "solo Create-athon". I used this as a chance to learn more about roblox-ts by completing the challenges in typescript. During this jam, I made a npc robot that:

- [x] Follow the player
- [x] Multiple robots follow the player
    - [x] While not bumping into the character
    - [x] While not bumping into other robots
- [x] Walk through doors
- [x] Jump over gaps
- [x] Pickup boxes and place the boxes down in another spot
